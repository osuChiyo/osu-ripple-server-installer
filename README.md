# How to use it?
It's simple. Firstly, you need to download it by either downloading it from GitHub, or running this command to download: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osuthailand/ripple-auto-installer/master/installer.sh`

After you do this, copy, paste and run the command: `chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh`, and it will take you into the install process!

Make sure you set your DNS like this:

* YOUR-DOMAIN
* c.YOUR-DOMAIN
* i.YOUR-DOMAIN
* a.YOUR-DOMAIN
* s.YOUR-DOMAIN
* old.YOUR-DOMAIN
